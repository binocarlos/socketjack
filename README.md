socketjack
==========

Prop up some sockets for jack

## Usage

Change to a local working folder first

then

	git clone https://github.com/binocarlos/socketjack.git socketjack
	cd socketjack
	npm install
	node index.js

This will run the very basic server - then you can goto localhost (or if you are live then IP)
and it should boot up.

It sends a single move and responds with the id - you can work the rest out : )
